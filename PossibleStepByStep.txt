So for the final L3 that will put everything together, I was thinking about the exact steps 
the robot needs to take in order to not bump into obstacles and center to get the nuts properly.  
Here is my idea.  Let me know what you think.
1) Begin and run Luke's General Pathing Code.
2) Everytime the Scuttle turns to avoid an object, check to see if a bolt/nut is in view. 
This is done using the L2_ColorTarget.py.  
3a) If there is an object in view, try to center the robot.  
    3b) Once centered, use L1_lidar.py to check if any obstacles are directly infront of the Scuttle.
    L1_lidar gives multiple points that are within the 135 to -135 area.  We just need to check the 
    area that is in front of the scuttle.
        3c) If it find that there are no obstacles in the direct front, start moving forward to pick up.
        3d) If there are obstacles, just continue with Luke's pathing.  
4) If there is no object, just continue with luke's pathing code.
